										</header>
                                        <p>This is a team design project about solving problems that are bothering people when they use a fridge. Through research, My teammate and I found out that most of our testers had experienced forgetting things when they bought the food and got the food rotten in the refrigerator. Based on the findings, we then performed user personas, journey maps, and several different research methods to specify the issue and test our design outcome. The recommendations we proposed is to install a touch screen on the fridge with a food expire alert system which asks users to scan or enter the expiration date before they put things in the fridge. We then built a prototype based on the result we have, leading to a design which will remind users by sending an alert once the food is close to the expiration date.</p>

                                            <p>Since performing usability tests helps the designers as well as the developers to uncover issues within their product as well as discovering new opportunities to revamp, we decided to include two tests in our research, survey and In-person scenario testing. </p>

In addition, we also noticed that there are several minor problems:</p>

                                            <p>This is the interface of the screen we proposed to install on the fridge door. To enhance convenience, we designed functions such as a section allowing users to see what they store in the fridge with the expiration date on the bottom of each item. In addition, users can look up recipes on the screen whenever they need some guidance. The interface also comes with a music playing function, which you can use it as a speaker in the kitchen. </p>

                                            <p><span>The Food Alarm:</span> The two images show how the alarm system works. If an item is close to its expiry date, the item image will be surrounded by a red frame. When it gets even more closer to the expiry date, a pop-out window will appear to remind the users.</p>
                                            <p><span>The Door Alarm:</span> Through our research we found out that some people have been dealing with not closing the door properly, thus wasting electricity and enhancing the probability of getting rotten food. To solve this problem, we add an alarm to the door as well.</p>
