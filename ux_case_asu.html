										</header>
                                        <p>ASU class search website is a website for students at ASU to look up for classes and add those classes to their schedule. It is a website full of powerful functionalities that aim to make the process of class searching easier for students. However, there are some problems in the website that decrease the usability, resulting in students might face difficulties and confusion when using the website. Take the consistency on the site as an example, when you click on the view my schedule button, instead of showing your current schedule on the website, it takes you to another website, which is My ASU page. This causes confusion to the users since the whole webpage’s layout is different, and the users will have to familiarize themselves with the website again. </p>

                                        <p>The goal of this UX case study is to find out problems of the website and identify some potential factors that lower the usability of the website. After identifying those problems and factors, suggestions will be made based on the data I collected through user research.</p>

                                            <p>In order to find out what else bothers the users of ASU Class Search, a designed survey is used in this research in order to collect more detailed information of how users interact with the ASU class search website. The survey is divided into four sections, demographic question section, experience of using the site section, external link experience and an overview rating section. Each section contains questions regarding different topics, and contains both qualitative ones and quantitative ones.  </p>

                                            <p>The survey was created on 9/10/2022, and will stop receiving responses on 9/24, which is about two weeks of collecting data. In order to get more responses, I’ve not only posted this survey on my personal social media account, I also asked some of my friends to deliver the survey to their friends and classmates as well. But, so far, I have only received 6 responses. </p>

                                            <h3 style="font-weight: 500;">User research</h3>
                                            <p>One thing I did not do so well in the user research phase was that the survey I created was not inclusive enough, making it harder for me to gather enough data to create personas and user stories. Also, some of my questionnaires in the survey were not clear enough or sort of leading participants toward a specific answer. This is something I definitely have to work on in the future.</p>

                                            <h3 style="font-weight: 500;">Personas</h3>
                                            <p>One of the main lessons learned from this part of the project is that the persona’s layout should be the same so that each of the personas contains the same information as another. This is helpful for research since that same layout makes it easier to do comparison. Another thing I noticed is that the needs and goals should be carefully addressed. Since that these two criteria are somewhat similar to each other, making sure that the needs are something that help users to achieve their goals is crucial.</p>

                                            </header>
                                            <p>Since I’ve already collected enough data from the users, I would like to start implementing the data I got into my prototype. For the prototype, I am planning on using “Figma” as my tool for it allows designers to build an interactive prototype. After that, I will take my prototype and perform a usability test on it to find out where to improve, whether it fulfills users goal or not.</p>
