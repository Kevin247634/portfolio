										</header>
                                        <p>ASU class search website is a website for students at ASU to look up for classes and add those classes to their schedule. It is a website full of powerful functionalities that aim to make the process of class searching easier for students. However, there are some problems in the website that decrease the usability, resulting in students might face difficulties and confusion when using the website. Take the consistency on the site as an example, when you click on the view my schedule button, instead of showing your current schedule on the website, it takes you to another website, which is My ASU page. This causes confusion to the users since the whole webpage’s layout is different, and the users will have to familiarize themselves with the website again. </p>

                                        <p>Since this is a personal project, my role in this project is both the ux researcher who conducted research to gather more information and the ux designer who provided possible design solutions to solve the problem.</p>

										</header>
                                        <p>The goal of this UX case study is to find out problems of the website and identify some potential factors that lower the usability of the website. After identifying those problems and factors, suggestions will be made based on the data I collected through user research.</p>

                                            <p>In order to find out what else bothers the users of ASU Class Search, a designed survey is used in this research in order to collect more detailed information of how users interact with the ASU class search website. The survey is divided into four sections, demographic question section, experience of using the site section, external link experience and an overview rating section. Each section contains questions regarding different topics, and contains both qualitative ones and quantitative ones.  </p>

                                                <p style="font-size: small; text-align: start; margin: 20px;">The one on the left is the current website. As you can see, the page does not have a link or button that allows users to go back to the previous search result page.
                                                This causes some usability issues since if users have more than one classes that they are interested in taking, they would have to keep going back to the homepage and type in same keywords in order to find the classes. </p>
                                                <p style="font-size: small; text-align: start; margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 20px;">My solution to this is to add a button on the cart page to let users navigate back to previous page if needed.</p>

                                            </header>
                                                <p style="font-weight: 500;">Solution: Instead of using several different websites to provide the function, those functions in the prototype are not embedded in the same website so that the layout now is consistent throughout the site.</p>

                                            <div style="text-align:center;">

                                                <img style="border: 2px solid; display:inline-block" src="images/asu_current_cart.png" width="500px"/>

                                            <p style="font-size: small; text-align: start; margin: 20px;">These are the two differnt layouts that are currently used on the ASU class search website. The one on the left is mainly used for searching, the right one is used when users are trying to add/ enroll in a class.
                                            When users find a class and want to add it to the cart, the website will navigate them from the left one to the right one, which as shown in the research, often casues confusion.</p>

To solve the problem mentioned above, I decided to combine two website into one, unifying the layouts so it's consistent and easier for user to navigate without getting confused.</p>

                                            <p>These three problems were the most needed improved ones based on my user research. Apart from these solutions, I also made some new design to the prototype that I think will enhance the usability of the website.

                                            <h3 style="font-weight: 500;">Data Collecting</h3>
                                            <p>If there is anything I want to improve upon first, it will be collecting more information through user research. Due to time limitations, I was only able to collect data from six ASU students. However, since there are so many different colleges and students in ASU, I wonder if different colleges’ students could have different results. Perhaps the usability issues found through my participants were not considered problems for students from other colleges, making it harder to integrate issues and prioritize what needs to be improved.

                                                I would definitely be interested in coming back to this project and doing some more research in the future.
                                                 
                                                </p>

                                            <h3 style="font-weight: 500;">User research</h3>
                                            <p>One thing I did not do so well in the user research phase was that the survey I created was not inclusive enough, making it harder for me to gather enough data to create personas and user stories. Also, some of my questionnaires in the survey were not clear enough or sort of leading participants toward a specific answer. This is something I definitely have to work on in the future.</p>

                                            <h3 style="font-weight: 500;">Personas</h3>
                                            <p>One of the main lessons learned from this part of the project is that the persona’s layout should be the same so that each of the personas contains the same information as another. This is helpful for research since that same layout makes it easier to do comparison. Another thing I noticed is that the needs and goals should be carefully addressed. Since that these two criteria are somewhat similar to each other, making sure that the needs are something that help users to achieve their goals is crucial.</p>

                                                What I think I benefited from this project the most is sharpening my skills of using Figam to create a prototype. In order to provide solutions to problems existing on current pages, I forced myself to learn and create a prototype that includes as many details as possible so that when taking it to do the usability test, the participants will be more assimilate into the scenario as if they are actually browsing the website to search for classes.
                                                
                                                Overall I am pretty satisfied with this case study, it was a project that brought me a lot of fun and I enjoyed the whole process of it.
