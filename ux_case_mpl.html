										</header>
                                        <p>This is a school project in which I was put in a scenario as a UX designer hired by a local library called McClintock Public Library to help redesign the library’s official website. The goal of this practice was to give us the opportunity to work as it is in the real industry, where designers need to constantly report the progress to stakeholders and present documentation to them. 
                                        </p>

										</header>
                                        <p>The current MPL website was built in the 1990s and has been working ever since then. It is now mainly used to provide some basic information of the library such as opening hours and events, there are no functions such as search/ reserve a book, ebook reader, application for a library card, etc.</p>

                                        <p>Besides having a list of desired functions and changes from the MPL library, I also conducted user research in this project to collect data from MPL’s target audience so that I could perform analysis such as personas, empathy mapping, and user journeys to further understand the user behavior and their needs. (Although it’s a fictional scenario, a lot of information was provided, including details of the library’s location, communities, and other detailed information were all written in the scenario to make the fictional scenario as real as possible). </p>
                                        <p><h3 style="font-weight: 400;">UX Designer</h3></p>
                                        <p>After doing research on the target audience, I then started making wireframes for both MPL’s website and mobile application as my design solutions.</p>

										</header>
                                        <p>The overall goal of this project is to come up with a new website/ app that enables users to have more flexibility using the website and to enhance the usability by providing needed functions that are discovered through user research.</p>

										</header>
                                        <h3 style="font-weight: bold;">Personas</h3>
                                        <p>User personas are archetypical users whose goals and characteristics represent the needs of a larger group of users. Because this was a project for a functional scenario, there were no actual “users” that I could access. However, I was able to identify three types of MPL’s target audience based on the information provided. The personas in this project was extremely helpful to the research since it gave me a chance to think deeply about the user's goals and needs. </p>                                           
                                        <div>
                                            <img style="float: left; margin-right: 30px;" src="images/mpl/mpl_ persona_1.jpg" width="600px;" />
                                            <p style="display: flex; align-items: center; height: 300px;">Miki represents the users of MPL who are busy and want to spend less time finding a book and to be able to read them easier.
                                                The main goal of this type of use is to speed up the searching/ borrowing process. A function allowing them to read books online would also be a good option for them.
                                                </p>
                                         </div>
                                         <br/>
                                         <br/>
                                         <div>
                                            <img style="float: left; margin-right: 30px;" src="images/mpl/mpl_ persona_2.jpg" width="600px;" />
                                            <p style="display: flex; align-items: center; height: 300px;">Thomas represents the users of the MPL website who does volunteer work at the library or people who look for library events online to get time information. 
                                                The goal for this type of users is to have a clear schedule of the event with time & location beside. 
                                                One thing to notice is that this type of users might be less tech savvy so that the website must have simple steps for them to find needed information.
                                                </p>
                                         </div>

                                            <p style="display: flex; align-items: center; height: 300px;">Christine represents the users who have children at home and are interested in bringing the kids to attend events held at MPL. 
                                                The goal of this type of user is to have more detailed information on the description of the events. It is important for them because bringing kids to the library isn’t something easy to do. So making sure that all information they need is provided can give them some relief. 
                                                </p>
                                         </div>

                                         <h3 style="font-weight: bold;">Empathy Mapping</h3>
                                         <p>An empathy map is a collaborative visualization used to articulate what we know about a particular type of user. In this project, I chose to use one of the persona- Miki to create an empathy map.</p>
                                         <div style="text-align: center;">
                                            <img src="images/mpl/mpl_empathy_map.jpg" width="800px;" />
                                            <p style="text-align: start;">In this empathy map, I marked down what Miki might do, think, and say during his process of listening to an audiobook. Two important insights took out from it were filter research was needed and the MPL website account should link with personal library card number, perhaps even able to add a new card under the account as well. </p>
                                         </div>
                                         <header>
                                            <h3 style="font-weight: bold;">Research Result</h3>
                                        </header>
                                        <p>Based on the personas, we found out that although the MPL website has different types of users, there is one common user goal that everyone is trying to achieve – To speed up the searching/ borrowing process. This can be shown on the frustration section in the personas and it is one of the issues that needs to be addressed. </p>
                                        <p>In addition to speeding up the whole searching/ borrowing process, below are some other findings concluded from the user research:</p>
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>Smart Search function with filter can help reduce the time spent on searching.</li>
                                            <li>Reserve ahead function would be a good fit for those who want to speed up the borrowing process.</li>
                                            <li>Ebooks & Audiobook Reader would be a great solution for those who don't have time to come to the library.</li>
                                        </ul>

                                        <p>This is the site plan I came up with for the MPL website. It clarifies what pages are on the website and shows the hierarchy of each page. For the navigation bar on the website, it follows the site plan as shown below, as for the navigation bar on the app, it changes a little bit by putting several links (such as about, contact, my account page) in a hamburger menu since I wanted to follow the app convention.</p>

                                        </header>
                                        <p>The reason for me choosing wireframes as design solution was because there were too many new functions the stakeholders wanted to add to the new website. This made me consider creating wireframes for both website and mobile app so that I can speed up the designing phase, and enable me to quickly present it to stakeholders to let them have a general idea and give me feedback.
                                        </p>
