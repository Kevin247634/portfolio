										</header>
                                        <p>This is a school project in which I was put in a scenario as a UX designer hired by a local library called McClintock Public Library to help redesign the library’s official website. The goal of this practice was to give us the opportunity to work as it is in the real industry, where designers need to constantly report the progress to stakeholders and present documentation to them. 
                                        </p>

										</header>
                                        <p>The current MPL website was built in the 1990s and has been working ever since then. It is now mainly used to provide some basic information of the library such as opening hours and events, there are no functions such as search/ reserve a book, ebook reader, application for a library card, etc.</p>

                                        <p>Besides having a list of desired functions and changes from the MPL library, I also conducted user research in this project to collect data from MPL’s target audience so that I could perform analysis such as personas, empathy mapping, and user journeys to further understand the user behavior and their needs. (Although it’s a fictional scenario, a lot of information was provided, including details of the library’s location, communities, and other detailed information were all written in the scenario to make the fictional scenario as real as possible). </p>
                                        <p><h3 style="font-weight: 400;">UX Designer</h3></p>
                                        <p>After doing research on the target audience, I then started making wireframes for both MPL’s website and mobile application as my design solutions.</p>

                                        <p>The overall goal of this project is to come up with a new website/ app that enables users to have more flexibility using the website and to enhance the usability by providing needed functions that are discovered through user research.</p>

										</header>
                                        <h3 style="font-weight: bold;">Personas</h3>
                                        <p>User personas are archetypical users whose goals and characteristics represent the needs of a larger group of users. Because this was a project for a functional scenario, there were no actual “users” that I could access. However, I was able to identify three types of MPL’s target audience based on the information provided. The personas in this project was extremely helpful to the research since it gave me a chance to think deeply about the user's goals and needs. </p>                                           
                                        <div>

                                            <p style="display: flex; align-items: center; height: 300px;">Miki represents the users of MPL who are busy and want to spend less time finding a book and to be able to read them easier.
                                                The main goal of this type of use is to speed up the searching/ borrowing process. A function allowing them to read books online would also be a good option for them.
                                                </p>

                                                The goal for this type of users is to have a clear schedule of the event with time & location beside. 
                                                One thing to notice is that this type of users might be less tech savvy so that the website must have simple steps for them to find needed information.
                                                </p>

                                                The goal of this type of user is to have more detailed information on the description of the events. It is important for them because bringing kids to the library isn’t something easy to do. So making sure that all information they need is provided can give them some relief. 
                                                </p>

                                         <h3 style="font-weight: bold;">Empathy Mapping</h3>
                                         <p>An empathy map is a collaborative visualization used to articulate what we know about a particular type of user. In this project, I chose to use one of the persona- Miki to create an empathy map.</p>
                                         <div style="text-align: center;">
                                            <img src="images/mpl/mpl_empathy_map.jpg" width="800px;" />
                                            <p style="text-align: start;">In this empathy map, I marked down what Miki might do, think, and say during his process of listening to an audiobook. Two important insights took out from it were filter research was needed and the MPL website account should link with personal library card number, perhaps even able to add a new card under the account as well. </p>
                                         </div>
                                         <header>
                                            <h3 style="font-weight: bold;">Research Result</h3>
                                        </header>
                                        <p>Based on the personas, we found out that although the MPL website has different types of users, there is one common user goal that everyone is trying to achieve – To speed up the searching/ borrowing process. This can be shown on the frustration section in the personas and it is one of the issues that needs to be addressed. </p>
                                        <p>In addition to speeding up the whole searching/ borrowing process, below are some other findings concluded from the user research:</p>
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>Smart Search function with filter can help reduce the time spent on searching.</li>
                                            <li>Reserve ahead function would be a good fit for those who want to speed up the borrowing process.</li>
                                            <li>Ebooks & Audiobook Reader would be a great solution for those who don't have time to come to the library.</li>
                                        </ul>

                                        <p>This is the site plan I came up with for the MPL website. It clarifies what pages are on the website and shows the hierarchy of each page. For the navigation bar on the website, it follows the site plan as shown below, as for the navigation bar on the app, it changes a little bit by putting several links (such as about, contact, my account page) in a hamburger menu since I wanted to follow the app convention.</p>

                                        </header>
                                        <p>The reason for me choosing wireframes as design solution was because there were too many new functions the stakeholders wanted to add to the new website. This made me consider creating wireframes for both website and mobile app so that I can speed up the designing phase, and enable me to quickly present it to stakeholders to let them have a general idea and give me feedback.

                                                    <li>"Class Status" should be defined clearly what is "Open class"? Are those classes that is opened but not available to be added supposed to be listed in open class? When I clicked advanced search and was shocked by too much columns, there's no way go back to original search?</li>

                                                <p style="font-weight: 500;">Solution: Adding a button to search result page so that users can navigate back to the previous page.</p>
                                       

                                            <div style="display:inline-block; text-align:center; background-color: beige; padding-top: 50px; padding-bottom: 10px;" >

                                                <p style="font-size: small; text-align: start; margin: 20px;">The one on the left is the current website. As you can see, the page does not have a link or button that allows users to go back to the previous search result page.
                                                This causes some usability issues since if users have more than one classes that they are interested in taking, they would have to keep going back to the homepage and type in same keywords in order to find the classes. </p>
                                                <p style="font-size: small; text-align: start; margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 20px;">My solution to this is to add a button on the cart page to let users navigate back to previous page if needed.</p>
                                            </div>

                                            <br/><br/>
                                           <header>
                                                <p style="font-weight: 500;">Problem 3: The Cart, Check my Schedule page has a different layout.</p>
                                            </header>
                                                <p style="font-weight: 500;">Solution: Instead of using several different websites to provide the function, those functions in the prototype are not embedded in the same website so that the layout now is consistent throughout the site.</p>

                                            <div style="text-align:center;">
                                                <img style="border: 2px solid; display:inline-block" src="images/asu_current_homepage.png" width="500px" />
                                                <img style="border: 2px solid; display:inline-block" src="images/asu_current_cart.png" width="500px"/>
                                            </div>
                                            <p style="font-size: small; text-align: start; margin: 20px;">These are the two differnt layouts that are currently used on the ASU class search website. The one on the left is mainly used for searching, the right one is used when users are trying to add/ enroll in a class.
                                            When users find a class and want to add it to the cart, the website will navigate them from the left one to the right one, which as shown in the research, often casues confusion.</p>
                                            
                                            <br/>
                                            <div style="text-align: center;">
                                                <img style="display: inline-block; border: 2px solid;" src="images/asu_figma_homepage_hover_cart.png" width="500px" />
                                                <img style="display: inline-block; border: 2px solid;" src="images/asu_figma_cart_uncircle.png" width="500px" />
                                            </div>
                                            <p style="font-size: small; text-align: start; margin: 20px;">These are the iterations I made. To solve the problem mentioned above, I decided to combine two website into one, unifying the layouts so it's consistent and easier for user to navigate without getting confused.</p>

                                            <p>These three problems were the most needed improved ones based on my user research. Apart from these solutions, I also made some new design to the prototype that I think will enhance the usability of the website.

                                            <h3 style="font-weight: 500;">Data Collecting</h3>
                                            <p>If there is anything I want to improve upon first, it will be collecting more information through user research. Due to time limitations, I was only able to collect data from six ASU students. However, since there are so many different colleges and students in ASU, I wonder if different colleges’ students could have different results. Perhaps the usability issues found through my participants were not considered problems for students from other colleges, making it harder to integrate issues and prioritize what needs to be improved.

                                                I would definitely be interested in coming back to this project and doing some more research in the future.
                                                 
                                                </p>

                                            <h3 style="font-weight: 500;">User research</h3>
                                            <p>One thing I did not do so well in the user research phase was that the survey I created was not inclusive enough, making it harder for me to gather enough data to create personas and user stories. Also, some of my questionnaires in the survey were not clear enough or sort of leading participants toward a specific answer. This is something I definitely have to work on in the future.</p>

                                            <h3 style="font-weight: 500;">Personas</h3>
                                            <p>One of the main lessons learned from this part of the project is that the persona’s layout should be the same so that each of the personas contains the same information as another. This is helpful for research since that same layout makes it easier to do comparison. Another thing I noticed is that the needs and goals should be carefully addressed. Since that these two criteria are somewhat similar to each other, making sure that the needs are something that help users to achieve their goals is crucial.</p>

                                                What I think I benefited from this project the most is sharpening my skills of using Figam to create a prototype. In order to provide solutions to problems existing on current pages, I forced myself to learn and create a prototype that includes as many details as possible so that when taking it to do the usability test, the participants will be more assimilate into the scenario as if they are actually browsing the website to search for classes.
                                                
                                                Overall I am pretty satisfied with this case study, it was a project that brought me a lot of fun and I enjoyed the whole process of it.
