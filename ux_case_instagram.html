											<h2 style="font-weight: bold;">Overview</h2>
										</header>

										<p>This UX case study is about the Instagram Website redesign. The goal of this project is to analyze the pros and cons of the website version by collecting data from surveys and interviews with users, 
											further comparing it to the app version to see if there is anything that can help increase the traffic of the Instagram website.
										</p>

										<header>
											<h3 style="font-weight: bold;">Problem Finding</h3>
										</header>
										<p>Although Instagram is designed primarily for phone use, there are still a huge amount of people who use it on a website. According to Hootsuite, a company which provides data for social media management, it was the six most visited websites in 2020. However, when I gather thoughts from people around me, I discovered that most people aren't satisfied with the current website.</p>
										<p>In order to find out what exactly is people’s attitude toward the website, I decided to conduct two UX research methods to identify the problems, Survey and Guerilla User Research.
										</p>

										<div style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: normal;">
											<ul><li>Survey</li></ul>
										</div>
										<p>The survey I created was divided into two parts and a total of seven questions, and had a total of 50 replies. For the first part of the survey, I asked questions related to the usage rate of the website; as for the second part, I mainly focused on how people want the website to be improved, questions like “What do you think can be improved on the Instagram Website?” were asked in the survey.

										</div>

										<div style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: normal; margin-top: 50px;">
											<ul><li>Guerilla User Research</li></ul>
										</div>
										<p>Since Guerilla User Research is a quick and low-cost way to discover more about people’s use experiences on something, I randomly chose two people from the survey and conducted an interview with them. In the research, I asked the following questions according to their survey replies, then I simply chatted with them and asked them for feedback on the current website.</p>
										
										<header>
											<h3 style="font-weight: bold;">Results</h3>
										</header>

										<p>Below are the problems I found that need to be improved in order to enhance the usability of the website.</p>
										<ol><li>Lack of some functions</li>
											<li>Weird layout arrangement</li>
											<li>Users are not used to the website</li>
										</ol>

										<header>
											<h3 style="font-weight: bold;">Goals of UX Case Study</h3>
										</header>
										<p>Judging from the problem findings, I concluded that the two tasks below are going to be my main goals in this UX project.</p>
										<ol><li>Make the layout of website more suitable for laptop screen</li>
											<li>Add functions to the currently website</li>
										</ol>

										<header>
											<h2 style="font-weight: bold;">Intervention</h2>
										</header>

										<header>
											<h3 style="font-weight: bold;">Framework</h3>
										</header>
										<p>Due to time limitations on this project, I only came up with a prototype that aims to fulfill my goals. In this prototype, Inot only redesigned the frame of the website to make it more suitable for a computer screen, also, I rearranged several layouts to make a better use of the space.</p>
										<p>In addition, I added lots of functions which are not available on the website now to my prototype, hoping that in this way it will enhance the possibility for users to use the website. For those who are interested in my prototype, here is the <a href="https://www.figma.com/proto/D8ZClTp7ApNfgrwPovrjIZ/Project-Instagram?node-id=1%3A2&starting-point-node-id=1%3A2">link</a>.</p>
										
										<header>
											<h3 style="font-weight: bold;">Mockups</h3>
										</header>
										
										<div>
										<ul style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: normal;"><li>Homepage</li></ul>
										<p>What I did to the homepage is rearrange everything and make it more suitable for a laptop screen. First, I made thestories frame longer so that users do not need to swipe left or right that much just to find a story they want to check. Second, I put the photo on the left and made the comment section sit beside it, which not only made the layout more even,but also made it easier for people to leave a comment.</p>
										</div>
										<img src="images/ighome.jpg" />
										<br/>
										<br/>
										<br/>

										<div>
											<ul style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: normal;"><li>Messeges Page</li></ul>
											<p>I came up with this layout that divided the web page into two sections, contacts and texts. Users can scroll up or down on the contacts to find the people they want to chat with, and by simply clicking on the person, the text section will automatically show up.</p>
										</div>
										<div style="text-align:center;">
											<img style="width: 1000px;" src="images/igmessege.jpg" />
										</div>
										<br/>

										<header>
											<h2 style="font-weight: bold;">New Funtionalities</h2>
										</header>
										<p>According to my surveys, 23% of people expressed the willingness to use the website more often if somecurrent unavailable functions were added. Thus, I decided to add the top three asked functions in my survey to the website, hoping that it can increase the traffic of the website.</p>
										<div style="text-align: center;">
											<img style="width: 600px;" src="images/ig_survey_function.jpg" />
										</div>
										
										<div>
											<ul style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: normal;"><li>Shop</li></ul>
											<p>This is the shop page that I made in my prototype. The items are placed in the squares, just like how the Instagram App design its shop page layout. I also kept the navigation tools on the top right corner so that users can always go back to the page they want to browse.</p>
										</div>
										<div style="text-align: center;">
											<img style="width: 600px;" src="images/ig_shop.jpg" />
										</div>

										<div>
											<ul style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: normal;"><li>Reels</li></ul>
											<p>The reason that I want to put this into the website is not just because the results of my survey suggested that I do it. With The impact of TikTok, nowadays there are more and more people from the younger generation looking to post not a photo, but a short video to share their daily life. Thus I think this is crucial to enhance the efficiency of attracting more users.</p>

										<header>
											<h2 style="font-weight: bold;">Testing Validation</h2>
										</header>
										<p>To test the results of my redesigned Instagram website, I used two testing methods which are commonly used in the UX field, the Five-second test and the Usability test.</p>
										<ul style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: normal;"><li>Five-second test</li></ul>
										<p>The reason I chose to use a five second test is that I want to know what people’s first impression of the redesigned prototype is. Therefore, I asked four of the people who filled out the survey before to participate in this test. After I let them see the prototype, I asked them three questions about it.</p>

										<ol><li>What is your first impression of the website?</li>
											<li>From 1 to 10, what score will you give to the new layout arrangement?</li>
											<li>From 1 to 10, what score will you give to the website base on the five second test?</li>
										</ol>
										<span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: 400;">Results</span>
										<div style="text-align: center;">
											<img style="width: 600px;" src="images/ig_fivesecond.jpg" />
										</div>
										<p>The five second test showed a very positive result, which implies the redesigned website did make a great impression totesters. Though this doesn’t mean that the users will fall in love with the it and thus dedicate themselves into thewebsite, it definitely affected people’s attitude, which may lead to an increase use of the Instagram website.</p>
										
										<ul style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: normal;"><li>Usability Test</li></ul>
										<p>There are a total of four users who participated in this test, they were all asked to fulfill three tasks during the test.</p>
										
										<ul><li>Task 1: Find the page of message and text the first people on the contact.</li>
											<li>Task2: Use the website to upload a photo.</li>
											<li>Task3: Find the page of short video and the page of the shop.</li>
										</ul>
										<span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: 400;">Results</span>
										<div style="text-align: center;">
											<img style="width: 600px;" src="images/ig_usabilitytest.jpg" />
										</div>
										<p>As shown above, every single task was done within 20 seconds, meaning that the redesigned website is to some degree self-explainable. Testers do not need to spend too much time on navigation. By recognizing the icon and bottom I chose,testers do not need extra information or hints to navigate themselves through the website.</p>
										
										<header>
											<h2 style="font-weight: bold;">Lesson Learned</h2>
										</header>

										<header>
											<h3 style="font-weight: bold;">Time</h3>
										</header>
										<p>Although I have pre-arranged a timeline for this UX project, I didn’t stick to it, causing my project to be a little behind the schedule. Fortunately, my friends are very supportive and willing to do the 5 second test and the usability test for me, otherwise I might not be able to finish my project on time.</p>

										<header>
											<h3 style="font-weight: bold;">Finding Testers</h3>
										</header>
										<p>When I was finding testers, I was lucky to have many friends who are all willing to help me out, however, I do want to find testers who are outside of my field or comfort zone. I think that in this way, I can reach a more diverse tester and probably have a better design result.</p>										

										<header>
											<h3 style="font-weight: bold;">Skills</h3>
										</header>
										<p>This is actually my first time for me to use Figma, and I spent tons of time trying to learn how this software works, which is fun but not really effective. In addition, I think there are some effects I would like to add to the prototype but I can't due to the limitation of the Figma itself. Therefore, I decided that I am going to learn some programming skills so that if there is something similar happens in the future, I will not be constrained again.</p>
